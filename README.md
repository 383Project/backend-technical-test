# 383Project - Technical Test

## General
This test is designed to focus on assessing how developers approach certain tasks, whilst also demonstrating programming
capability, followed by displaying knowledge of the languages/frameworks/packages.

Whilst you can spend as long as you would like on it, we recommend you spend no longer than a few hours.

The use of well supported, open source packages is allowed.

You should complete this test yourself and shouldn't outsource any of the work.

## Technical
We primarily use Laravel, Wordpress and React/NextJS for our web based systems, among other technologies - so we heavily prefer that you 
use this stack for this test.

There is the option to make a front end side of this task, but this isn't necessary.

## The Task

> Note: This is entirely fictional and none of the results from the test will be used by 383Project.

Our client would like a site developed that allows for retrieval of weather forecasts

There would be further phases of development to introduce this, but the client would like a phase 1 for an initial release.

The client has no specific requirements in terms of design.

## Phase 1

- Allow a user to sign up to the site.
  - Collect users preferred location.
- Allow the user to log in to the site.
- Once logged in, pull and display weather forecasts from the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for the 
week in the users preferred location.
  - Be able to select a single day in order to display more information for that day.
  - Be able to change the location
- Backend to show signed up users and location
